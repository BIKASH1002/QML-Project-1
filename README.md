# **Harnessing Quantum Computing for Stock Market Prediction**

The world of finance is characterized by its inherent complexity, non-linearity and volatility making the prediction of stock market trends a formidable challenge. This research dealt with quantum machine learning to revolutionize the landscape of stock market prediction. Quantum computing with its unparalleled computational power derived from the principles of quantum mechanics offers a promising avenue for addressing the limitations of classical machine learning algorithms in financial forecasting. Through the integration of quantum computing technologies, this work module aims to develop a quantum regression model that can capture elusive patterns and hidden correlations with financial data. The field of quantum machine learning is new and in the development phase so the model implemented is a simulator making use of “Qiskit” and “Pennylane” library but when run using actual quantum device the process and prediction would be very quick to deliver results. For our case it resulted in the mean square error of 1.01% which shows its promising performance and potential to predict. The study will also explore the practical challenges and constraints associated with quantum computing in the 
financial sector.
